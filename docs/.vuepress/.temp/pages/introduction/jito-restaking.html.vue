<p><a href="https://github.com/jito-foundation/restaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jito (Re)staking</a> is a multi-asset staking protocol for node consensus networks. The protocol tokenizes staked assets as vault receipt tokens (VRT) for enhanced liquidity and composability. Node consensus networks can use Jito Restaking to easily customize staking parameters, and economic incentives to tailor their security and tokenomics.</p>
