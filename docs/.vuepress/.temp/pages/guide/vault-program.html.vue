<p>The Vault program is for creating and managing VRTs, and allowing users to deposit and withdraw their assets. Managing VRTs involves registering relationships with Vaults and NCNs, managing delegations with Operators, and setting fees.</p>
<h3 id="initialize-vault" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#initialize-vault"><span>Initialize Vault</span></a></h3>
<p>For these programs, as an NCN creator you will need to initialize your NCN and establish relationships with Operators and Vaults, both on chain and off chain.</p>
